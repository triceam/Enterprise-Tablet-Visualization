The Enterprise Tablet Visualization application is a sample application built using Adobe Flex and AIR.   The application is not a production application.  It demonstrates realtime data push to a mobile application using LiveCycle Data Services, realtime multimedia collaboration using LiveCycle Collaboration Services, as well as multi-form-factor UI for both tablet and phone devices, including map integration and interactive data visualizations.
